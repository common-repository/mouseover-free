== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Uploading images doesn't work? = 

Depending on your WordPress version, it is a common issue that the image upload option is not working properly.

Two ways to solve that:

1. On your WP admin, please use the "Media" -> "Add New" tab, upload your image and copy the "File URL", usually looks like: http://www.YourDomain.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Image_Name.png and paste this URL on the relevant line " default Image" or " Mouse-over Image".

2. Second solution is in case the image is already published and is hosted somewhere on the internet.  Right click on the image to "copy shortcut" for IE or "copy link location" for Firefox browser, and paste this URL on the relevant line "default Image" or " Mouse-over Image".
